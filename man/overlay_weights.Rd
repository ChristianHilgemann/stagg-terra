\title{Function to find spatial overlap between a raster and a set of polygons}
\usage{
overlay_weights(
  polygons,
  polygon_id_col,
  grid = era5_grid,
  secondary_weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{a simple features polygon or multipolygon object}

\item{polygon_id_col}{the name of a column in the sf object with a unique
identifier for each polygon}

\item{grid}{a raster layer with the same spatial resolution as the data}

\item{secondary_weights}{an optional data.table of secondary weights, output
from secondary_weights()}
}
\value{
a data.table of area weights and possibly secondary weights for each
cell within polygons (area weighted raster/polygon overlap)
}
